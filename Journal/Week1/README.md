*✨What did I do this week✨*

2.I Explored the course theme and requirements, including using Unity to develop a VR-compatible prototype.
3.Considered which type would inspire a meaningful and funny VR concept


*✨My App Inspiration & Initial Concept in studio✨*

After thinking and discussing different types of desktop and mobile apps, I decided to use Word as the inspiration for my VR project. I want to create a personal space for file writing and self-recording in VR.

My main goal is to design a safe space that supports private and meaningful writing. In this space, the user can walk in and write a journal or stick notes freely. It gives the feeling of being alone with your thoughts in a comfortable room.

In my idea, I plan to change the original Word features like cloud saving and keyboard typing into more visual and hand-based interactions. For example, the user can open a floating journal, write something, or place a sticky note on a wall. They can also store their thoughts in different corners of the space.

I hope this concept can help me explore how to combine emotional design and immersive interaction in a simple and creative way.
